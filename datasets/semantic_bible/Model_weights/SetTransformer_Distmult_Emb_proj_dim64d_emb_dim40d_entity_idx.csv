"The ethnicity or, more generally, cultural heritage of a person. This can overlap with both religiousBelief (which may, however, change over time) and nativePlace (which, like ethnicity, does not change, though residency might). Whether a given property represents ethnicity or citizenship (nativePlace) can be a difficult decision, but in general, ethnic identities like ""Jewish"" or ""Greek"" take precedence. For example, we consider the Apostle Paul to have Jewish ethnicity, though he was a citizen of Tarsus, because he was raised as a Jew. Ethnicity is not specified without specific evidence, either textual or reliable tradition: for example, having a Greek name is not sufficient. ",1855

"The notion of 'Jewish' as an ethnicity is problematic given the long history of God's chosen people and their many circumstances. Here it refers broadly to the Jewish identity, and is applied to all those from Abraham through Peter and Paul who would designate themselves as Jewish. In particular, no attempt is made to distinguish pre-Mosaic Jewish ethnicity from later forms. Israelite is only used a few times in the New Testament, and in those instances, it is treated synonymously with Jewish. ",1870

"This is distinct from Jewish as an ethnic heritage, which implies birth: one can have a ReligiousBelief of Judaism through conversion, despite not having Jewish ethnicity. Those who convert to other beliefs (most notably for the New Testament, Christianity) are typically designated as having Jewish ethnicity, but Christianity as a ReligiousBelief. There is no implication of faithful devotion to the Jewish faith. ",1886

"This person may be the same as the Lucius in Rome, but there's no clear evidence other than the name.",1893
